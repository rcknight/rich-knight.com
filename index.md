title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m a software developer living in Devizes, UK, working for [Corsham Science](http://corshamscience.com). My day job is mostly .NET development, but I enjoy tinkering with a wide range of tech on, many of which are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/rcknight).

Outside the world of tech I am enthusiastic about photography, film, comics and coffee.

If you want to get in touch you can email [hi@rich-knight.com](mailto:hi@rich-knight.com) or find me on Twitter at [@rcknight](https://twitter.com/rcknight).
