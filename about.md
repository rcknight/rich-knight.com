I'm a software developer living in Chippenham, UK, working for [Cognisant](http://cognisantresearch.com) and [Event Store](https://geteventstore.com). 

My day job is mostly .Net development, but I enjoy tinkering with various other tech in my spare time, some of which you can read about on my blog. You can check out some of my projects below.

If you want to get in touch you can email me at [hi@rich-knight.com](mailto:hi@rich-knight.com) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rcknight) and [GitHub](https://github.com/rcknight).
