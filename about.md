I'm a software developer living in Chippenham, UK, working for [Cognisant](http://cognisantresearch.com) and [Event Store](https://geteventstore.com). 

My day job is mostly .Net development, but I enjoy tinkering with other tech on various side projects, some of which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/rcknight) or the [projects page] of this site.

If you want to get in touch you can email [hi@rich-knight.com](mailto:hi@rich-knight.com) or find me on twitter at [@rcknight](https://twitter.com/rcknight).
